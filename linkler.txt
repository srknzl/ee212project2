Topic : Staircase ramp ADC

The goal is to find 3 links and 3 videos that explains this topic the best.
At the end, write a 1 page report to explain what lead you to decide like that. 

Links:
1- http://www.eeeguide.com/principles-of-adc/

In this link staircase ramp ADC is explained beautifully because this is the first
link I am reading and I understand the topic very well. In the site there are figures,
such as internal circutry of staircase ramp adc, illustration of the "stair" concept. 
I liked these figures.

In this site there is a figure that is very good. It shows an anolog circuit in green
color and digital staircase steps as red under it. Another plot under it shows the 
corresponding digital points decided. This helped me to understand how the circuit 
works when input analog signal is not stationary. Moreover, I also understood that faster 
counters are better. Second, since this site has a figure that is describing the internal
representation of the circuit in a more detailed way, I understood counter is resetted 
when the signal exceeds input signal. Third, this site gave this insight: the lower the input's 
signal power is lower the shorter distance between the corresponding digital points. Foutrh,
I found two different and good disadvanteges of the staircase ramp adc with good justification.

I liked this explanation because there are explanatory texts in the image of internal representation
of the circuit. Next to every component in the circuit, the explanation exists. 

Videos:

In this video, there is a woman describing the concept very well and slowly. I liked the explanation.
Also she points out the "digital" and "analog" concepts very well. Again, she explains why we call 
counter type to this type perfectly. The diagram, fluence, everything was good.

In this video, diagrams and text that are written on the notebook are very clear, this is plus. 
Another upvote that I give to this video is, he follows through circuit and explains what happens
where. At the end, he explains what resolution is and what is its formula. The conversion from analog
sinusoidal signal is shown by drawing analog signal and stair underneath it.

The sound is good, fluency is good also. There is not a face looking to you, you follow it from paper,
but quality is good. First, classification of adcs is done which is good. He gave example of truth table
to show how conversion results would be.
